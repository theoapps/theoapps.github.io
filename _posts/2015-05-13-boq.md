So my newest iOS app just got released last weekend. Titled, -boq-. As it's name illustrates, boq is all about drawing symmetrical boxes. It's simple, creative, mind-relaxing, and when you're done, you have a pretty cool piece of art. I used to draw them manually all the time back when I was in school, so I'm really excited to finally have an app to do it on. I have a lot of ideas for more features, so stay tuned for updates!
