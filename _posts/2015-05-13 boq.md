So my first iOS app in years just got released last weekend. Titled, -boq-. As it's name illustrates, boq is all about drawing symmetrical boxes. It's simple, creative, mind-relaxing, and when you're done, you have a pretty cool piece of art. I used to draw them manually all the time back when I was in school, so I'm really excited to finally have an app to do it on. Also excited to be indie developing again! Apple says I've gotten 26 downloads so far, while Google Analytics says I have 65 users.. hmm.. iOS piracy or Google hijacking? I'm just happy other people seem to be interested. I have a lot of development ideas, so stay tuned for updates!
